# Customising Fractal

Fractal offers a number of ways to extend its functionality.

[Template engine adapters](../customisation/template-engines.html) let you use pretty much any JavaScript-based templating library instead of Handlebars, and [theme customisation](../customisation/web-themes.html) can give you a web UI completely tailored to the needs of your project.

You can also use [custom CLI commands](../cli/custom-commands.html) to create command-line tasks that lean on the power of Fractal's API to better integrate you component library into your development workflow.
