# Including Sub-components

Often you will want to include one component within another component. For instance, you may have a 'button' component that you want to include as a sub-component of a 'search box' component (as well as potentially within a number of other components).

Using the default Handlebars template engine, that might look something like this:

```handlebars
<!-- button.hbs -->
<button type="button" name="submit">Search</button>
```

```handlebars
<!-- search-box.hbs -->
<div class="searchbox">
    <input type="search" name="keywords">
    {{> @button }}
</div>
```

As you can see, the `search-box.hbs` component view file uses the standard [Handlebars partial include](http://handlebarsjs.com/#partials) syntax to include the button template, with one difference - instead of using a *path* to the template, it uses the [`@handle` syntax](../core-concepts/naming.html#referencing-other-items) to refer to the button component by its handle.

It's important to note that the syntax for including one component's view template within another **will depend on which [template engine](../customisation/template-engines.html) you are using**. For instance, if you were using the [Nunjucks engine](https://github.com/frctl/fractal/tree/main/packages/nunjucks) you would instead use Nunjuck's `include` tag to include sub components. For example:

```html
<!-- parent.nunj -->
<div class="parent">
    {% include '@child' %}
</div>
```

## Container Components via @partial-block

Apart from naming the subcomponent you'd want to include directly, you can also use handlebar's built in `@partial-block` to be able to wrap components inside container components. This is useful for creating preview templates where you want to be able to view a component variation inside a container component.

```handlebars
<!-- container.hbs -->
<div class="container">
  {{> @partial-block}}
</div>
```

Then you can use it like so:

```handlebars
{{#> container}}
  {{> anotherPartial}}
{{/container}}
```

Or even in a preview template:

```handlebars
{{#> container}}
  {{ yield }}
{{/container}}
```

## Providing context data to sub-components

When you include a sub-component in the manner described above, it's important to note that you are effectively just including the contents sub-component's view file. **It will not automatically include any [context data](../core-concepts/context-data.html) that you may have defined for that sub-component.**

To handle passing context data for your included sub-components, you have a number of options:

* A) Use the [render helper](../core-concepts/view-templates.html#handlebars-helpers) to render the sub-component in-place, using its own context data.
* B) Define a complete set of context data in the parent component's config file
* C) Reference context data for sub-components using the '@handle' [static data reference syntax](../core-concepts/naming.html#referencing-other-items) from within the parent component's context data.

Let's look at how each of these might work in turn.

### A) Using the `render` helper

Both the default [Handlebars template engine](../core-concepts/view-templates.html#template-rendering) and the [Nunjucks engine](https://github.com/frctl/fractal/tree/main/packages/nunjucks#helpers) come with a `render` helper to use in your templates, instead of the standard partial/include syntax.

Unlike the standard 'include' syntax, the `render` helper renders a sub-component in-place, using its own context data (unless overridden by data passed into it). This is a good solution if you want to **render a sub-component with its own context data**, AND you don't mind using a custom helper function to handle the rendering.

::: tip
If you are planning on consuming your template files outside of Fractal, you may **not** want to use a custom helper if it is will not be supported in your target environment.
:::

An example might look like this:

```handlebars
<!-- button.hbs -->
<button type="button" name="submit">{{ button.text }}</button>
```

```yaml
# button.config.yml
context:
  button:
    text: A Button
```

```handlebars
<!-- search-box.hbs -->
<div class="searchbox">
    <label for="search">{{ label }}</label>
    <input type="search" name="keywords" id="search">
    {{ render '@button' }}
</div>
```

```yaml
# search-box.config.yml
context:
  label: Search
```

::: v-pre
You can see in this case, we don't need to specify any context data for the `button` sub-component in the `search-box.config.yml` - instead the `{{ render }}` helper will automatically render the `button` using the context data defined in its own `button.config.yml`.
:::

You can also override all or a just a sub-set of the sub-component's default context data - see the [Handlebars helpers](../core-concepts/view-templates.html#handlebars-helpers) or the [Nunjucks helpers](https://github.com/frctl/fractal/tree/main/packages/nunjucks) documentation for more info.

### B) Define all context data in the parent component's config

This is a good approach for when you want to render an instance of the sub-component that should use a **different set of context data** to that which is provided in the sub-component's config file.

For example, you may want to render a 'prose' component on its own with a set of Lorem Ipsum default content, but when pulled into a 'homepage' component you may want to override that with page-specific content.

Using this method, our example would look like this:

```handlebars
<!-- button.hbs -->
<button type="button" name="submit">{{ button.text }}</button>
```

```yaml
# button.config.yml
context:
  button:
    text: A Button
```

```handlebars
<!-- search-box.hbs -->
<div class="searchbox">
    <label for="search">{{ label }}</label>
    <input type="search" name="keywords" id="search">
    {{> @button }}
</div>
```

```yaml
# search-box.config.yml
context:
  label: Search
  button:
    text: Go!
```
You can see that in this case, the parent (`search-box`) component is providing a whole new set of context data, including the `button` object with its `text` property. The rendered output of both of these components would look like:

```html
<!-- @button -->
<button type="button" name="submit">A Button</button>
```

```html
<!-- @search-box -->
<div class="searchbox">
    <label for="search">Search</label>
    <input type="search" name="keywords" id="search">
    <button type="button" name="submit">Go!</button>
</div>
```

So in this case the parent component is responsible for defining the context data used by both itself *and* and data needed by any sub-components.

### C) Use context data '@handle' references

If you *don't* want to specify new data for all the sub-components in the parent's configuration file (and you don't want to use the `render` helper) you can use the  '@handle' [static data reference syntax](../core-concepts/naming.html#referencing-other-items) to dynamically pull context from the sub-component's configuration in to the parent component's context.

If we re-work the example above to use this technique it would look like this:

```handlebars
<!-- button.hbs -->
<button type="button" name="submit">{{ button.text }}</button>
```

```yaml
# button.config.yml
context:
  button:
    text: A Button
```

```handlebars
<!-- search-box.hbs -->
<div class="searchbox">
    <label for="search">{{ label }}</label>
    <input type="search" name="keywords" id="search">
    {{> @button }}
</div>
```

```yaml
# search-box.config.yml
context:
  label: Search
  button: "@button"
```

The last line in the `search-box.config.yml` file (`button: "@button"`) ensures that the `button` context data property will be set to the value of the context data object defined in the button component; this is a reference that is resolved when the parent component is rendered.

In this case, when rendered the components will look like:

```html
<!-- @button -->
<button type="button" name="submit">A Button</button>
```

```html
<!-- @search-box -->
<div class="searchbox">
    <label for="search">Search</label>
    <input type="search" name="keywords" id="search">
    <button type="button" name="submit">A Button</button>
</div>
```

You can see that in the `@search-box` component the button text is now the same as the text defined in the `button.config.yml` file.

See the documentation on [referencing other component\'s data](../core-concepts/context-data.html#data-references) for more information on using this technique.

### Fully rendering a sub-component <Badge text="added in v1.3.0" type="tip"/>

If you're creating templates for a rendering system that uses bottom-up rendering, you may need to replace a variable with the complete markup from a sub-component.
You can reference a component in your context and prefix it with `@@` to do this.

For example, if you wanted to write templates for Drupal's local menu tasks -

```twig
<!-- menu-local-task.twig -->
<li{{ attributes }}>{{ link }}</li>
```

```yaml
# menu-local-task.config.yml
context:
  attributes:

variants:
  - name: active
    context:
      attributes: "class=\"is-active\""
```

```twig
<!-- menu-local-tasks.twig -->
<ul>
  {% for tab in primary %}
    {{ tab }}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

```yaml
# menu-local-tasks.config.yml
context:
  primary:
    - @@menu-local-task
    - @@menu-local-task--active
```
